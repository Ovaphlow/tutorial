hello guys and welcome back

we've covering the rumors and steam db leaks around a Borderlands 2 or pre-sequel DLC for a while now

and it seems like we finally got confirmation that one of the suprises Gearbox plans to show off at e3 2019 will be a new DLC for Borderlands 2

playstation lifestyle wrote an article with their anonymous sources with first-hand knowledge
and they claim that we will see new Borderlands 2 content in a couple of weeks to bridge the gap between Borderlands 2 and the beginning of Borderlands 3

we know there is a seven-year jump between games and a lot has happened

so the alleged working title for the expansion is commander Lilith and the fight for sanctuary
the source saids the DLC which will be for Borderlands 2 will be dropping sometime during e3 week
and to get prepared by redownload in the game and getting all the updates in preparation

this does line up with Gearbox tweeting out earlier that we will get big surprises at e3

and that they aren't done showing us everything

platforms are unknown at this time but it will most likely be for current gen consoles

so the PS4, XBox one and PC

we already know last gen consoles had memory limitations

so if you are a last gen console player most likely this won't be coming to your console which is unfortunate

but we've know this for a while now that all the console limitation and it just isn't possible for Gearbox to sqeeze anything else out on then

so we don't have any more information than that

but just off the title alone we well probably see what happens to sanctuary and eventually sanctuary 2

we know the ship that takes us from playing it's a planet in Borderlands 3 is called sanctuary 3

and that we don't talk about sanctuary 2 Gearbox has been hinting this with all the codes and different things in the covers

and Gearbox has to show us the fall of the sanctuaries

so Gearbox doesn't have another fall of New Haven on their hands

which was in Borderlands 1 where we never saw this epic battle that basically threw the Crisom Raiders out of New Haven

on top of that Gearbox recently added that rainbow rarity to Borderlands 3 of few weeks ago

which is most likely also tied to this new DLC

so there whill be a new rarity

it doesn't look like there are any new exclusive guns added yet to this rarity

but this rarity can be applied to any weapon in game currently

a few other things we can speculate is that we will get our first look at Mordecai's new bird talent and action

who we haven't seen yet and any of the Borderlands trailers of images

we can also hopefully see breaks new puppy because we know on his necklace, he gains and loses another puppy after the events of Borderlands 2

but before the events of Borderlands 3, another leak we got about this DLC is that Gearbox was adding

what looks like a horde mode or some sort of Battle Royale, sort of mechanic that does a life drain if you aren't in a certain area

i doubt they would add Battle Royale in this DLC

but it does look like they have a mechanic

maybe they'll make a joke about it

or there will be a new horde mode or as i said something along those lines that they'll use this mechanic for

there are a ton of videos if you guys want to go back and see all my steam db updates and previous coverage on this
you can go check that out

Gearbox has been working on this for a long time now

and it does look like it will be a lot of content

so we will just have to wait and see what Gearbox has been adding and planning

that's what i'm going to end this video

e3 if you don't know starts on June 11 and goes until June 13

so that's just a few weeks away

and hopefully this is the surprise

Gearbox has been hinting that all the time
