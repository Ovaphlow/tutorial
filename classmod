what's going on guys

this is VinylicPuma back with another Borderlands video

and today I'd like to go over the best farming methods to get any class mod in this game

so whether it be the blue rarity Banshee class mod for Maya, the chaotic evil monk  class mod that you're trying to get for Salvador or even some legendary class mods

this video will go over how to get them all in the best and most efficient ways possible real quick

and before we start, it is important that you smashed like for three tubby spiderants here

you've got to admit that you haven't seen three tuby spiderants before

and like any bad magician, i'll reveal how this was done later on in the video

so be sure to smash like and leave a comment below on what your favorite class mod in Borderlands 2 is
